This prototype aims to explore alternative user experience which combines the best of Conversational Search and traditional search using Bolt as prototyping tool


How chat interfaces help user are
-They enable natural interaction:
Users can directly state their need without need to need to learn site specific jargons or go off site to find correct vocabulary to search.
Examples "jumpsuit vs playsuit".
-Enabling natural interaction compresses multiple steps which occur between Intent-Articulation
This reduces the search journey and leads to faster product clicks from searches, faster clicks to products leads to lower drop offs in journey.
-**Contextual Follow up**:Based on previous chat context,follow up questions can be presented to user to narrow down the search results.

However there are some disadvantages in how chat interfaces are being deployed
-**Limited options**  While it helps in reducing the search journey, it was severely limiting in the number of options provided.This is due to inherent nature of chat UI.You cannot have infinite scroll of results in a chat window.
-**Lack of refining search results**:Again a limitation of chat UI.Instead of using elements like facets, sort, filter which are familiar tools to narrow search, conversational search meant typing the same query with more and more parameters.
At one point this effort is greater than simply using filters and sort elements.
-**Query Reformulation**:Ideally conversational search should lead to lower query reformulation, but due to missing refinement options it lead to more query reformulation.
-**Black Box of Results**: There is often a lack of explainability in the search results.So if there is mis-parsing of intent users will not know what went wrong or what part of query was mapped to the result.
Note:To the credit of Team Pyng,the search results had a heavy emphasis on explainability in chat.

**Hybrid Approach**
Is it possible to combine the best of two approaches?How would that look like
-**Reduce steps in Articulation-Formulation**.
We would be digressing from our goal of reducing user effort if the search still ends up putting the burden on the user to understand and find correct vocabulary.This maintains the powerful intent capturing mechanism from conversational search.This element can be represented by traditional form of search barand also support keyword search.

-**Ability to display scrollable list of search results.** 
Even though more results are friction inducing for users, paradoxically reducing the results degrades it further.Too few results frustrate the users and lead to higher abandonment.
To enable this searches should also include partial matches, because returning a narrow or empty result set signals the catalogue is “too small” even when items exist elsewhere.https://baymard.com/blog/2021-luxury-ecommerce-benchmark 

-**Maintain traditional search UI elements**
Maintaining traditional UI elements like facets ,sort and filters to enable users to refine results with a click.If users are sent in a "query do-over" loop users will abandon the search process faster.

-**Explainability**:Provide explanations on product attributes which map to user queries and why the attributes match to the query.Visible facets reduce the black box of anxiety problem for users.
