This prototype aims to explore alternative user experience which combines the best of Conversational Search and traditional search using Bolt as prototyping tool


The benefits of conversational search are
  • Enables natural interaction (no need to know terms like “jumpsuit vs playsuit”)
  • Compresses Intent–Articulate–Formulate into one step
  • Uses chat context to ask clarifying follow-ups, reducing bounce

Although, the shortcomings of chat-only search are
  • Limited options: Chat UIs can't show full scrollable results like grids which artificially limit options
  • Poor refinement UX:This just creates more typing effort for users.
  • Higher reformulation: Users repeat their intent in different waysdue to missing refinement
  • Black-box feel: No transparency on why a product was shown.

So what's the fix? A Hybrid Search Experience.
  • Use AI to reduce articulation burden, but keep it in traditional search bar instead of chat window
  • Return scrollable and a wide variety of results, not just 3 chat cards
  • Preserve facets, sort,  filters,otherwise users enter loop of reformulating queries.
  • Improve explainability by attribute chips & match rationale to improve transparency of results.

**Hybrid Approach**
Combining the best of two approaches
-**Reduce steps in Articulation-Formulation**.
We would be digressing from our goal of reducing user effort if the search still ends up putting the burden on the user to understand and find correct vocabulary.This maintains the powerful intent capturing mechanism from conversational search.This element can be represented by traditional form of search barand also support keyword search.

-**Ability to display scrollable list of search results.** 
Even though more results are friction inducing for users, paradoxically reducing the results degrades it further.Too few results frustrate the users and lead to higher abandonment.
To enable this searches should also include partial matches, because returning a narrow or empty result set signals the catalogue is “too small” even when items exist elsewhere.https://baymard.com/blog/2021-luxury-ecommerce-benchmark 

-**Maintain traditional search UI elements**
Maintaining traditional UI elements like facets ,sort and filters to enable users to refine results with a click.If users are sent in a "query do-over" loop users will abandon the search process faster.

-**Explainability**:Provide explanations on product attributes which map to user queries and why the attributes match to the query.Visible facets reduce the black box of anxiety problem for users.
